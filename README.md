# BFS-and-DFS-Simulation
The project is a simple interactive JavaFX simulation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms on graphs.

## 1. Introduction

This project was developed as part of the CS203 - Algorithms and Data Structures course, and it represents a simulation of the BFS and DFS algorithms on graphs. The project was developed in the IntelliJ IDEA development environment using JavaFX.

The application allows users to interactively create graphs, add and connect nodes, and visualize the results of the BFS and DFS search algorithms. Users can delete nodes and reset the scene to start over.

## 2. Architecture

The application is divided into several key components, which include graph manipulation, user event handling, and the implementation of BFS and DFS algorithms.

## 3. Application Methods

The application contains a set of methods that facilitate working with the graph:

- **handleMouseClick:** Handles mouse clicks for creating and selecting nodes.
- **addNode:** Adds a new node to the graph.
- **handleMousePressed/Released:** Creates edges between nodes.
- **deleteNode:** Deletes a node and its edges.
- **resetGraph:** Resets the entire scene.
- **bfs/dfs:** Implements the BFS and DFS algorithms.
- **showAlert:** Displays the search results in an alert window.
